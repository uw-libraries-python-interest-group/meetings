## Agenda:

### Quick welcome for new attendees/information about the PIG
- [Community Agreement](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/meetings/blob/main/README.md#community-agreement) can be viewed at our [meetings](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/meetings) repository, which is where notes and shared resources from meetings can be found!
- If you are working through [Learn Python 3 the Hard Way](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/l9c4fq/CP71290856150001451) and would like to share exercise-related code, or look at examples from others, see the [lp3thw](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/lp3thw) repository (let [BMR](mailto:ries07@uw.edu) know if you'd like to be a contributor to the repo)

### Quick note re: PIG meetings for 2021
- Requesting feedback on the current PIG meeting schedule: **Meet once every three weeks, Thursday at 11:00**
    - Please email [BMR](mailto:ries07@uw.edu) if you'd prefer a different meeting time
    - If it seems that readjusting meeting times would be good, we'll set up a poll, etc.
    - If not, we'll schedule for the first half of 2021 as above

## Presentation and discussion
