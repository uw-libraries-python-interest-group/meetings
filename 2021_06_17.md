An introduction to using Jupyter Notebooks

## Before the Workshop - Software Installation 
Probably the easiest way to get Jupyter Notebooks up-and-running on most any machine is to download and install [Anaconda (Individual Edition)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). This software package is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux computers.

Once installed, it will allow you to open and run Jupyter Notebooks using your computers graphical interface.

Bring any questions regarding Jupyter setup to the next Python Interest Group meeting (via [Zoom](https://washington.zoom.us/j/92822247598)), on May 27 at 11:00 a.m.
