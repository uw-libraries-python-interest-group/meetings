Notes on (some **\***) University of Washington Libraries Python Interest Group (UWL-PIG) meetings

**\*** *Particularly those including presentations and discussion about Python coding projects in and around the Libraries*

## Community Agreement
Beginning in late 2020, the UWL-PIG began focusing increasingly on providing opportunities to learn about "real-world" Python coding projects, by inviting individuals to informally present on and/or workshop their Python scripting.

In order to support our learning community and make the most of our shared space, the PIG has decided to adopt and adapt a community agreement originally developed for use by the UW Libraries' Digital Scholarship Collective:

### As a group, we:
- Are sensitive to the needs of others
- Give mutual respect, particularly when folks are making themselves and their work vulnerable
- Actively listen and engage with fellow group participants
- Recognize the intelligence and expertise in the group
- Acknowledge when we don't know something
- Value people over tools
- Seek lightness, collegiality, and humor
- Are flexible, as we acknowledge that our values and needs may change over time
